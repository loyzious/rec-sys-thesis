  abstract  = {We give a classical analogue to Kerenidis and Prakash's quantum recommendation system, previously believed to be one of the strongest candidates for provably exponential speedups in quantum machine learning. Our main result is an algorithm that, given an m × n matrix in a data structure supporting certain ℓ 2-norm sampling operations, outputs an ℓ 2-norm sample from a rank-k approximation of that matrix in time O(poly(k) log(mn)), only polynomially slower than the quantum algorithm. As a consequence, Kerenidis and Prakash's algorithm does not in fact give an exponential speedup over classical algorithms. Further, under strong input assumptions, the classical recommendation system resulting from our algorithm produces recommendations exponentially faster than previous classical systems, which run in time linear in m and n. The main insight of this work is the use of simple routines to manipulate ℓ 2-norm sampling distributions, which play the role of quantum superpositions in the classical setting. This correspondence indicates a potentially fruitful framework for formally comparing quantum machine learning algorithms to classical machine learning algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Recommendation System is a major area which is very popular and useful for people to take proper automated decisions. It is a method that helps user to find out the information which is beneficial to him/her from variety of data available. When it comes to Movie Recommendation System, recommendation is done based on similarity between users (Collaborative Filtering) or by considering particular user's activity (Content Based Filtering) which he wants to engage with. To overcome the limitations of collaborative and content based filtering generally, combination of collaborative and content based filtering is used so that a better recommendation system can be developed. Also various similarity measures are used to find out similarity between users for recommendation. In this paper, we have surveyed state-of-the-art methods of Content Based Filtering, Collaborative Filtering, Hybrid Approach and Deep Learning Based Methods for movie recommendation. We have also reviewed different similarity measures. Various companies like facebook which recommends friends, LinkedIn which recommends job, Pandora recommends music, Netflix recommends movies, Amazon recommends products etc. use recommendation system to increase their profit and also benefit their customers. This paper mainly concentrates on the brief review of the different techniques and its methods for movie recommendation, so that research in recommendation system can be explored.},

  abstract  = {Collaborative filtering (CF) is an effective method, which is widely applied in a great deal of recommendation systems. It can extract latent user preferences and item features from user-item rating matrix, by making use of Matrix Factorization (MF)'s technique to generate recommended items. However, the traditional MF based recommendation methods are faced with sparsity problems caused by unavailable and incomplete user-item rating datasets, which greatly degrades the accuracy of recommendation results. To address the sparsity problem caused by unavailable and incomplete datasets, we propose a sparsity-aware hybrid collaborative recommendation approach with multi-source and heterogeneous data in this paper. Firstly, we adopt more abundant and accessible implicit feedback data rather than explicit user-item rating data to overcome the data unavailability issue. Moreover, to address the "Missing not at random" (MSAR) problem with implicit feedback data, we adopt auxiliary data from user profile or item content to generate more accurate user preference and item features; which will be fused into the MF model to generate accurate recommendation results. More specifically, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Stacked Denoising Auto Encoder (SDAE) are used as feature extractor, thereby generating user preferences and item features. Finally, we did a lot of experiments on several datasets to assess the proposed recommendation approach. The results indicate that, compared with pure matrix factorization, the hybrid collaborative recommendation model combining extra latent user/item representation can enhance the recommended results' accuracy; while the time consumption is almost the same.},

  abstract = {Along with the rapid expansion of digital music formats, managing and searching for songs has become significant. Though music information retrieval (MIR) techniques have been made successfully in last ten years, the development of music recommender systems is still at a very early stage. Therefore, this paper surveys a general framework and state-of-art approaches in recommending music. Two popular algorithms: collaborative filtering (CF) and content-based model (CBM), have been found to perform well. Due to the relatively poor experience in finding songs in long tail and the powerful emotional meanings in music, two user-centric approaches: context-based model and emotion-based model, have been paid increasing attention. In this paper, three key components in music recommender-user modelling, item profiling, and match algorithms are discussed. Six recommendation models and four potential issues towards user experience, are explained. However, subjective music recommendation system has not been fully investigated. To this end, we propose a motivation-based model using the empirical studies of human behaviour, sports education, music psychology.},

However, challenges remain in the form of data-scarcity, cold-start, scalability, time consumption and accuracy. In this article, we provide an overview of recommendation systems in the e-learning context following four strands: Content-Based, Collaborative Filtering, Knowledge-Based and Hybrid Systems. We developed a taxonomy that accounts for components required to develop an effective recommendation system.

  abstract  = {Recommendation systems that provide appropriate solutions to users to reduce their decision complexity have become popular in the Internet world. Designing and evaluating such systems remain essential challenges to researchers and practitioners. Toward that end, a critical task is how to obtain user preferences. Mobile phones have become indispensable in everyday life, yet fierce market competition, characterized by rapid introductions of different models with novel designs and advanced features, have made consumers' purchase decision making increasingly complex. As a well-established, multiple criteria decision technique, analytic hierarchy processing (AHP) provides an intuitive model of a hierarchical structure capable of supporting complex product comparisons and evaluations by consumers. In this paper, we illustrate the application of an AHP-based mechanism to develop a Web-based recommendation system and empirically evaluate the prototype by conducting a controlled experiment with 244 mobile phone users, focusing on both content and system satisfaction. Our evaluation includes benchmark systems built on rank-based analysis and an equal weight-based system as comparative baselines. Overall, the results suggest the viability and value of using AHP to construct effective recommendation systems. Subjects appear satisfied with the recommendations by the AHP-based system, though its relatively demanding input requirements may need mitigation and adequate interface designs. This study contributes to research and practice in recommender systems in general and helps develop mobile phone recommendation systems for online stores and consumers in particular.},

However, the traditional methods of the RSs basically rely on the static user/item feature vectors and ignore the fine-grained user-item interactions which could affect the accuracy of the RSs. Thus, this paper proposes a RS model that exploits neural attention techniques to learn adaptive user/item representations and fine-grained user-item interaction for enhancing the accuracy of the item recommendation. An attentive pooling layer is first designed based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn the adaptive latent features of the user/item from reviews. A mutual attention network technique is then introduced for modelling the fine-grained user-item interaction to enable jointly capturing the most informative features at the higher granularity. Finally, a prediction layer is then applied for the final prediction based on the adaptive user/item representation and the user/item importance. We extensively conduct a series of experiments using Amazon and Yelp reviews, and the results demonstrate that our proposed model performs better than the existing methods in terms of both rating prediction and ranking performances. Statistical paired test show that all the performance improvements are significant at p<0.05.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a new technique for contextual item-to-item Collaborative Filtering-based Recommender System, an improved version popularised by e-commerce giant Amazon two decades back. The concept is based on items also-viewed under the same browsing session. Users' browsing patterns, locations, and timestamps are considered as the context and latent factors for each user. The algorithm computes recommendations based on users' implicit endorsements by clicks. The algorithm does not enforce the user to log in to provide recommendations and is capable of providing accurate recommendations for non-logged-in users and with a setting where the system is unaware of users' preferences and profile data (nonlogged-in users). This research takes the cue from human lifelong incremental learning experience applied to machine learning on a large volume of the data pool. First, all historical data is gathered from collectable sources in a distributed manner through big data tools. Then, a long-running batch job creates the initial model and saves it to Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). An ever-running streaming job loads the model from HDFS and builds on top of it in an incremental fashion. At the architectural level, this resembles the big data mix processing Lambda Architecture. The recommendation is computed based on a proposed equation for a weighted sum between near real-time and historical batch data. Real-time and batch processing engines act as autonomous Multi-agent systems in collaboration. We propose an ensemble method for batch-stream the recommendation engine. We introduce a novel Lifelong Learning Model for recommendation through Multi-agent Lambda Architecture. The recommender system incrementally updates its model on streaming datasets to improve over time.},

To generate true recommendations, we have proposed an intelligent approach which also deals with large-sized heterogeneous data to fulfill the needs of the potential customers. e collaborative filtering (CF) approach is one of the most popular techniques of the RS to generate recommendations. We have proposed a novel CF recommendation approach in which opinion-based sentiment analysis is used to achieve hotel feature matrix by polarity identification. Our approach combines lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and semantic analysis to understand sentiment towards hotel features and the profiling of guest type (solo, family, couple etc). e proposed system recommends hotels based on the hotel features and guest type for personalized recommendation. e developed system not only has the ability to handle heterogeneous data using big data Hadoop platform but it also recommends hotel class based on guest type using fuzzy rules. Different experiments are performed over the real-world datasets obtained from two hotel websites.

These systems passively track different sorts of user behavior, such as purchase history, watching habits and browsing activity, in order to model user preferences. Unlike the much more extensively researched explicit feedback, we do not have any direct input from the users regarding their preferences. In particular, we lack substantial evidence on which products consumer dislike. In this work we identify unique properties of implicit feedback datasets. We propose treating the data as indication of positive and negative preference associated with vastly varying confidence levels. This leads to a factor model which is especially tailored for implicit feedback recommenders. We also suggest a scalable optimization procedure, which scales linearly with the data size. The algorithm is used successfully within a recommender system for television shows. It compares favorably with well tuned implementations of other known methods. In addition, we offer a novel way to give explanations to recommendations given by this factor model.},

  abstract  = {Recommender Systems are indispensable to provide personalized services on the Web. Recommending items which match a user's preference has been researched for a long time, and there exist a lot of useful approaches. Especially, Collaborative Filtering, which gives recommendation based on users' feedbacks to items, is considered useful. Feedbacks are categorized into explicit feedbacks and implicit feedbacks. In this paper, Collaborative Filtering with implicit feedbacks is addressed. Explicit feedbacks are feedbacks provided by users intentionally and represent users' preferences for items explicitly. For example, in Netflix, users can rate movies on a scale of 1-5, and, based on these ratings, users can receive movie recommendation. On the other hand, implicit feedbacks are collected by the system automatically. In Amazon.com, products that users buy and click are used for recommendation. While Collaborative Filtering with explicit feedbacks has been a central topic for a long time, implicit feedbacks have become a more and more important research topic recently because these are easier to obtain and more abundant than explicit feedbacks. However, implicit feedbacks are often noisy. They often contain feedbacks which do not represent users' real preferences for items. Our approach addresses to this noise problem. We propose three discounting methods for observed values in implicit feedbacks. The key idea is that there is hidden uncertainty for each observed feedback, and effects by observed feedbacks of much uncertainty are discounted. The three discounting methods do not need additional information besides ordinary user-item feedbacks pairs and timestamps. Experiments with huge real-world datasets confirm that all of the three methods contribute to improving the performance. Moreover, our discounting methods can easily be combined with existing methods and improve the recommendation accuracy of existing models.},

  abstract  = {The implicit feedback based collaborative filtering (CF) has attracted much attention in recent years, mainly because users implicitly express their preferences in many real-world scenarios. The current mainstream pairwise methods optimize the Area Under the Curve (AUC) and are empirically proved to be helpful to exploit binary relevance data, but lead to either not address the ranking problem, or not specifically focus on top-k recommendation. Although there exists the listwise method maximizes the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), it has low efficiency and is not particularly adequate for general implicit feedback situations. To that end, in this paper, we propose a new framework, namely Collaborative List-and-Pairwise Filtering (CLAPF), which aims to introduce pairwise thinking into listwise methods. Specifically, we smooth another well-known rank-biased measure called Mean Average Precision (MAP), and respectively combine two rank-biased metrics (MAP, MRR) with the pairwise objective function to capture the performance of top-k recommendation. Furthermore, the sampling scheme for CLAPF is discussed to accelerate the convergence speed. Our CLAPF framework is a new hybrid model that provides an idea of utilizing rank-biased measures in a pairwise way on implicit feedback. Empirical studies demonstrated CLAPF outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on real-world datasets.},

  abstract  = {In today's business environment, the trend towards more product variety and customization is unbroken. Due to this development, the need of agile and reconfigurable production systems emerged to cope with various products and product families. To design and optimize production systems as well as to choose the optimal product matches, product analysis methods are needed. Indeed, most of the known methods aim to analyze a product or one product family on the physical level. Different product families, however, may differ largely in terms of the number and nature of components. This fact impedes an efficient comparison and choice of appropriate product family combinations for the production system. A new methodology is proposed to analyze existing products in view of their functional and physical architecture. The aim is to cluster these products in new assembly oriented product families for the optimization of existing assembly lines and the creation of future reconfigurable assembly systems. Based on Datum Flow Chain, the physical structure of the products is analyzed. Functional subassemblies are identified, and a functional analysis is performed. Moreover, a hybrid functional and physical architecture graph (HyFPAG) is the output which depicts the similarity between product families by providing design support to both, production system planners and product designers. An illustrative example of a nail-clipper is used to explain the proposed methodology. An industrial case study on two product families of steering columns of thyssenkrupp Presta France is then carried out to give a first industrial evaluation of the proposed approach.},

  abstract  = {As a typical latent factor model, Matrix Factorization (MF) has demonstrated its great effectiveness in recommender systems. Users and items are represented in a shared low-dimensional space so that the user preference can be modeled by linearly combining the item factor vector V using the user-specific coefficients U. From a generative model perspective, U and V are drawn from two independent Gaussian distributions, which is not so faithful to the reality. Items are produced to maximally meet users' requirements, which makes U and V strongly correlated. Meanwhile, the linear combination between U and V forces a bijection (one-to-one mapping), which thereby neglects the mutual correlation between the latent factors. In this paper, we address the upper drawbacks, and propose a new model, named Correlated Matrix Factorization (CMF). Technically, we apply Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to map U and V into a new semantic space. Besides achieving the optimal fitting on the rating matrix, one component in each vector (U or V) is also tightly correlated with every single component in the other. We derive efficient inference and learning algorithms based on variational EM methods. The effectiveness of our proposed model is comprehensively verified on four public datasets. Experimental results show that our approach achieves competitive performance on both prediction accuracy and efficiency compared with the current state of the art.},

In addition, we design a specialized parallelization scheme utilizing model parallelism on the embedding tables to mitigate memory constraints while exploiting data parallelism to scale-out compute from the fully-connected layers.

In this chapter, we review a range of evaluation metrics and measures as well as some approaches used for evaluating recommendation systems. The metrics presented in this chapter are grouped under sixteen different dimensions, e.g., correctness, novelty, coverage. We review these metrics according to the dimensions to which they correspond. A brief overview of approaches to comprehensive evaluation using collections of recommendation system dimensions and associated metrics is presented.

Despite all the benefits of an online learning platform, users face some challenges and complexities, such as selecting appropriate learning material and courses based on their needs and preferences. Hence, the provision of quality resources during the training phases is their central responsibility, the lack of online assistance offered by service providers is known to be the key cause of many difficulties. There is a need to create a system that can intelligently propose courses while considering a variety of viewpoints to enhance the learners' skills and knowledge. This research proposes an architecture that builds semantic recommendations with the aid of virtual agents based on user requirements and preferences, assisting academia in seeking appropriate courses in a real-world setting.

  abstract  = {In Recommendation Systems (RS) and Collaborative Filtering (CF), the similarity measures have been the operating component upon which CF performance is essentially reliant. A dozen of similarity measures have been proposed to reach the desired performance particularly under the circumstances of data sparsity (the cold-start problem). Nevertheless, these measures still suffer the cold-start problem, and have a complex design. Moreover, a comprehensive experimental work to study the impact of the cold-start problem on CF performance is still missing. To these ends, therefore, this paper introduces three simply-designed similarity measures, namely, difference-based similarity measure (SMD), hybrid difference-based similarity measure (HSMD), and, triangle-based cosine measure (TA). Along with proposing these measures, a comprehensive experimental guide for CF measures using the K-fold cross validation is also presented. In contrary to all previous CF studies, the evaluation process is split into two sub-processes: the estimation process and recommendation process to accurately obtain the desired appropriateness in the evaluation. In addition, a new formula to calculate the dynamic recommendation count is developed depending on both the dataset and rating vectors. To draw a comprehensive experimental analysis, a dozen state-of-the-art similarity measures (30 similarity measures) including the proposed and the most widely-used traditional measures are comparatively tested. The experimental study has critically been made on three datasets with five-fold cross-validation grounded on the K nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN). The obtained results on both estimation and recommendation processes prove unquestionably that SMD and TA are preeminent measures with the lowest computational complexity outperforming all state-of-the-art CF measures.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a set of algorithms to extract metadata about the documents in a digital library from the way these documents are used. Inspired by the learning of connections in the brain, the system assumes that documents develop stronger associations as they are more frequently co-activated. Co-activation corresponds to consultation by the same user, and decreases exponentially with the time interval between consultations. The strength of activation is proportional to the user's interest for the document, either evaluated explicitly, or inferred implicitly from user actions or the duration of the consultation. Co-activation values are added, producing a matrix of associations. This matrix can be used to recommend the documents that are most strongly related to a given document, most relevant to the user's implicit interest profile, or most interesting to users overall. Moreover, it allows the calculation of document similarity values, which in turn can be used to cluster similar documents. The data needed to feed such a recommendation system are readily extracted from the usage logs of document servers, and can be processed either in a centralized or a distributed manner.},

  abstract  = {Online stores can give their customers access to millions of products, unlike retail stores. In online stores, with a large number of products to review, approaches that can recommend the right product to the customer are needed based on the customer's interests. In the literature, there are different methods that make product recommendations to customers, based on previous choices of customers. In general, we find that these studies are common when customers clearly provide ratings for their products. However, we observe a lack of data modeling approaches that indirectly capture customer ratings based on customer click data. For this purpose, within the framework of this research, we propose two different methods for indirect modeling of user ratings. We have developed a prototype application to show the feasibility of the proposed methods. The obtained data were tested with two state-of-the-art methods, alternating least squares (ALS) and collaborative filtering (CF). Clickstream data, obtained from an e-commerce book site, was used in the study. The results show that the proposed data modeling approaches can be used.},

Data ablation is incorporated into the offline model training process to improve the robustness of the production system. In offline evaluation using a dataset collected from eBay traffic, our approach was able to improve the Recall@k metric over the Recently-Viewed-Item (RVI) method. This approach to generating personalized recommendations has been launched to serve production traffic, and the corresponding scalable engineering architecture is also presented. Initial A/B test results show that compared to the current personalized recommendation module in production, the proposed method increases the surface rate by ∼6% to generate recommendations for 90% of listing page impressions.},

Second, fashion products are usually seasonal, so customers' general preference changes according to the time of year. Last, customers usually purchase items to replace previously preferred items or purchase items to complement those already bought. We propose a new system called K-RecSys, which extends the typical item-based collaborative filtering algorithm by reflecting the above domain characteristics. K-RecSys combines online product click data and offline product sale data weighted to reflect the online and offline preferences of customers. It also adopts a preference decay function to reflect changes in preferences over time, and finally recommends substitute and complementary products using product category information. We conducted an A/B test in the actual operating environment to compare K-RecSys with the existing collaborative filtering system implemented with only online data. Our experimental results show that the proposed system is superior in terms of product clicks and sales in the online shopping mall and its substitute recommendations are adopted more frequently than complementary recommendations.},

  abstract  = {Over 80 approaches for academic literature recommendation exist today. The approaches were introduced and evaluated in more than 170 research articles, as well as patents, presentations and blogs. We reviewed these approaches and found most evaluations to contain major shortcomings. Of the approaches proposed, 21% were not evaluated. Among the evaluated approaches, 19% were not evaluated against a baseline. Of the user studies performed, 60% had 15 or fewer participants or did not report on the number of participants. Information on runtime and coverage was rarely provided. Due to these and several other shortcomings described in this paper, we conclude that it is currently not possible to determine which recommendation approaches for academic literature are the most promising. However, there is little value in the existence of more than 80 approaches if the best performing approaches are unknown.},

  abstract  = {With the spread of COVID-19, the "untact" culture in South Korea is expanding and customers are increasingly seeking for online services. A recommendation system serves as a decisionmaking indicator that helps users by suggesting items to be purchased in the future by exploring the symmetry between multiple user activity characteristics. A plethora of approaches are employed by the scientific community to design recommendation systems, including collaborative filtering, stereotyping, and content-based filtering, etc. The current paradigm of recommendation systems favors collaborative filtering due to its significant potential to closely capture the interest of a user as compared to other approaches. The collaborative filtering harnesses features like user-profile details, visited pages, and click information to determine the interest of a user, thereby recommending the items that are related to the user's interest. The existing collaborative filtering approaches exploit implicit and explicit features and report either good classification or prediction outcome. These systems fail to exhibit good results for both measures at the same time. We believe that avoiding the recommendation of those items that have already been purchased could contribute to overcoming the said issue. In this study, we present a collaborative filtering-based algorithm to tackle big data of user with symmetric purchasing order and repetitive purchased products. The proposed algorithm relies on combining extreme gradient boosting machine learning architecture with word2vec mechanism to explore the purchased products based on the click patterns of users. Our algorithm improves the accuracy of predicting the relevant products to be recommended to the customers that are likely to be bought. The results are evaluated on the dataset that contains click-based features of users from an online shopping mall in Jeju Island, South Korea. We have evaluated Mean Absolute Error, Mean Square Error, and Root Mean Square Error for our proposed methodology and also other machine learning algorithms. Our proposed model generated the least error rate and enhanced the prediction accuracy of the recommendation system compared to other traditional approaches.},

MF models decompose the observed user-item interaction matrix into user and item latent factors. In this paper, we propose a cofactorization model, CoFactor, which jointly decomposes the user-item interaction matrix and the item-item co-occurrence matrix with shared item latent factors. For each pair of items, the co-occurrence matrix encodes the number of users that have consumed both items. CoFactor is inspired by the recent success of word embedding models (e.g., word2vec) which can be interpreted as factorizing the word co-occurrence matrix. We show that this model significantly improves the performance over MF models on several datasets with little additional computational overhead. We provide qualitative results that explain how CoFactor improves the quality of the inferred factors and characterize the circumstances where it provides the most significant improvements.},

Existing researches generally use a pseudo-rating matrix by adding up the number of item consumption; however, this naïve approach may not capture user preferences correctly in that many other important user activities are ignored. In this paper, we show that users' diverse implicit feedbacks can be significantly used to improve recommendation accuracy. We classify various users' behaviors (e.g., search item, skip, add to playlist, etc.) into positive or negative feedback groups and construct more accurate pseudo-rating matrix. Our preliminary experimental result shows significant potential of our approach. Also, we bring out a question to the previous approaches, aggregating item usage count into ratings.},

However, the translation of a prediction algorithm into an operationally usable machine learning model is a time-consuming and in various ways challenging task. In this work, we target to systematically elicit the challenges in deployment and operation to enable broader practical dissemination of machine learning applications. To this end, we first identify relevant challenges with a structured literature analysis. Subsequently, we conduct an interview study with machine learning practitioners across various industries, perform a qualitative content analysis, and identify challenges organized along three distinct categories as well as six overarching clusters. Eventually, results from both literature and interviews are evaluated with a comparative analysis. Key issues identified include automated strategies for data drift detection and handling, standardization of machine learning infrastructure, and appropriate communication and expectation management.},

  abstract  = {Recommender systems are typically evaluated in an offline setting. A subset of the available user-item interactions is sampled to serve as test set, and some model trained on the remaining data points is then evaluated on its performance to predict which interactions were left out. Alternatively, in an online evaluation setting, multiple versions of the system are deployed and various metrics for those systems are recorded. Systems that score better on these metrics, are then typically preferred. Online evaluation is effective, but inefficient for a number of reasons. Offline evaluation is much more efficient, but current methodologies often fail to accurately predict online performance. In this work, we identify three ways to improve and extend current work on offline evaluation methodologies. More specifically, we believe there is much room for improvement in temporal evaluation, off-policy evaluation, and moving beyond using just clicks to evaluate performance.
